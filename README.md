Thank you for taking the time to review my project. 
I was able to complete the API steps to build all API requests, however I did not have enough time to complete the unit testing code and hence left out for a stable build. 
I did however complete testing using POSTMAN and include the Students.postman_collection file if this is helpful. This can be found in the root of the GitHub repository.
